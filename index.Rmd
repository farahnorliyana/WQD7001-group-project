#### Data Science Process Involved - activities in the data science pipeline

><font size="4">1. Research understanding: We have identified to problems and questions related to this research prior to its execution in order to establish clear understanding of the project as a whole</font><br/>
<font size="4">2. Analytic approach: We have identified the best way to represent the data that we have</font><br/>
<font size="4">3. Data requirements, collection and understanding, preparation: The data that we used are retrieved from the web, which relates to road safety, transport statistics, road accidents statistics, ASEAN road statistics among others.</font><br/>
<font size="4">4. Modeling and evaluation: We have gathered the data and visualized them in the form or charts and heatmaps in order to summarize them in a graphical method. Should the model becomes irrelevant, we have discarded them in order to project only relevant ones which will help to achieve our objectives.</font><br/>
<font size="4">5. Deployment: The product has been deployed into RPubs and live for the world to see. Audience may provide us with constructive feedback to further make this product better.</font><br/>
